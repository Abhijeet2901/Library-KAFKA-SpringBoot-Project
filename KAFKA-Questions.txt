I have following questions regarding Kafka:

Q- If I create a topic and specify no of partitions more than no of brokers, then a single broker will handle more than 1 partition?
A- That is correct. If you have more partitions than available brokers, then some of your brokers will store more than one partition per topic.
For example, let's assume you have one alive broker and a topic with two partitions; Your broker will look like below:
    +-------------------+
    |      Topic X      |
    |    Partition 0    |
    |                   |
    |                   |
    |     Topic X       |
    |   Partition 1     |
    +-------------------+

Q-If I create a topic and specify replication factor more than no of brokers, will the topic create or not?
A- No, it is not possible to create topic with higher replication factor than the available brokers. If you attempt to do it you will get an error.
For example, let's say you are trying to create a topic with --replication-factor 3 and only one available broker:
>> bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 1 --topic myTestTopic

Error while executing topic command replication factor: 3 larger than available
brokers: 1
kafka.admin.AdminOperationException: replication factor: 3 larger than available
 brokers: 1

        at kafka.admin.TopicCommand$.main(TopicCommand.scala:55)

Q- Can a single broker will handle multiple partitions of different topic.
A- Definitely. Let's say you have only 2 brokers and 3 topics each of which has 2 partitions with a replication-factor=1. An example overview of your brokers is shown below:
    +-------------------+
    |      Topic 1      |
    |    Partition 0    |
    |                   |
    |                   |
    |     Topic 3       |
    |   Partition 1     |
    |                   |
    |                   |
    |     Topic 2       |
    |   Partition 1     |
    +-------------------+


    +-------------------+
    |      Topic 1      |
    |    Partition 1    |
    |                   |
    |                   |
    |     Topic 3       |
    |   Partition 0     |
    |                   |
    |                   |
    |     Topic 2       |
    |   Partition 0     |
    +-------------------+
